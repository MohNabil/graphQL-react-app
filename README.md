This is a graphQL-react app i made while i was following a tutorial to learn the graphQL 

The app uses apollo client with react and different packages found in the package.json file

The app is divided to two folders the client side and the server side

To use the app you need to npm install the packages then npm start to load the server for the client side and nodemon to load the server side and connect to the mLab database
